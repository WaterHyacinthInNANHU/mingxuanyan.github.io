Have you seen this crying faceüò≠? How about üòÇ, ü•∫, ü§£, or ‚ù§Ô∏è? Looks familiar? Well, you should be. According to emojipedia, [they are the top 5 most used emojipedia in twitters in 2021](https://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-trends-of-2021/).
By December 2021, a total of 21.54% of all global tweets have at least one of the 3,633 emojis approved by the [Unicode Consortium](https://blog.emojipedia.org/unicode-behind-the-curtain/).
In fact, emoji becomes so popular that [Oxford dictionary listed üòÇ as the word of 2015](https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2015/).
Nowadays people are using emoji in virtually any platform, including [Tiktok](https://emojipedia.org/tiktok/),
[instagram](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-the-emoji-slider-sticker)
, or [email](https://www.guidingtech.com/top-ways-to-insert-emojis-in-a-microsoft-outlook-email/)
. Many people even [choose to incorporate emoji into their username](https://start.y.at/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F).
In fact, an Artificial Intelligence startup huggingface ü§ó is 
evaluated [at $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/05/09/the-2-billion-emoji-hugging-face-wants-to-be-launchpad-for-a-machine-learning-revolution/?sh=61b47f51f732)
and will potentially be the first company to ‚Äúgo public with an emoji, rather than a three-letter ticker‚Äù.

## From XD to üòÇ

In our daily face-to-face conversations, 
we often make use of body language, facial expression or acoustic tone <d-cite key="chen2017through"></d-cite> to better convey our emotions. 
Yet such means becomes impossible when we move toward online conversations, 
in which we have access to text and plain text only. 
Scott Fahlman is probably one of the first people to try imitating more diverse and profound information with plain text. 
Emoticons, as later was called, were designed to convey emotion using plain ASCII characters, 
two of the most famous Emoticon being ‚Äú:-)‚Äù and ‚Äú:-(‚Äú. 
While emoticons like "XD" is easy to understand due to resemble to human faces, 
some of the emoticons seem to be more cultural orientated and hard to be understood by someone outside of the community.
For example, I probably would never guess the meaning for "#‚Äë)"<d-footnote>If you are also wondering, it means "partied all night".</d-footnote>
Of course, the never-satisfaied internet users demand more expressive symbols, leading to the development of emoticon's succeeder, emoji. 

Originated in Japanese ÁµµÊñáÂ≠ó, the name _emoji_ itself precisely express its function: Áµµ (e) being picture, while ÊñáÂ≠ó (moji) being character.
The first widely-used emoji is designed by Shigetaka Kurita. 
[It has 250 characters only](https://emojitimeline.com/#:~:text=The%20World's%20First%20Emoji%20Set,Unicode%20Standard%2C%20the%20poo%20emoji). 
From this we can grasp what Sheigetaka deemed as the top 250 most important characters in the daily conversation at that time.

Emojis gradually become an integral component in postmodern language.
It is estimated that 92% of the online population use emoji, and at least 2.3 trillion mobile messages
incorporate emoji annually as of 2016 <d-cite key="goldman2018emojis"></d-cite>.
In 2021, Adobe [released the global emoji trend report](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/15/global-emoji-trend-report-2021)
showing that 55% of global emoji users are more comfortable expressing emotions through emoji than phone conversations, 
90% of global emoji users agree that emoji make it easier for them to express themselves. 
What's more, although having only 23 years of history, emojis themselves are still expanding rapidly. 
Emoji version 8 (so-called Unicode Version 8.0) came up in 2015, i.e. 8 versions in 16 years, while version 14 came out last year, i.e. roughly one updated version in each year.
Therefore, it is not so surprising to see someone will exclaim something like this:
{% twitter https://twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/1539544755830288384 %}

## Emojis are cultural construct ü§î
Don‚Äôt you like emoji? 
Don‚Äôt you think adding a cute emoji makes the conversation more friendly üòâ? 
Adobe report shows that 88% of the global emoji users are more likely to feel empathetic toward someone if they use an emoji. 
I remember once I wanted to do research with a professor at USC, and write a long email expressing my eagerness and my competency. 
In the end, I want to ‚Äúappeal to the emotion‚Äù and want my professor to have some personal connection with me. 
Hey, we all belong to the Trojan family, I thought. 
Thus I typed ‚ÄúFight on‚úåÔ∏è!‚Äù in the end of the email 
(by the way [this is also the favorite emoji in USC](https://twitter.com/usc/status/1151504550018203648?lang=en)!). 
I hope that this will give the professor a sense of bondness. 
Does it work? Well, I did get the opportunity of doing research, and in the email my Professor sent back, she also concludes the email with  ‚ÄúFight on‚úåÔ∏è!‚Äù

Use paper word
Emoji, as a medium of conversation, inevitably 
The interpretation of emoji is conditioned on the person. 
Trojan motto is embedded in the simple emoji ‚úåÔ∏è, but what about the outsiders? 
How will they perceive the symbol‚úåÔ∏è? 
According to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/victory-hand/), 
the symbol ‚úåÔ∏è, or victory hand, represnts nothing but the [V sign](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/V_sign). 
It is USC and its motto that injects the meaning of fight on into it, 
therefore if I am going to send someone outside of Trojan family, 
I probably won‚Äôt use  ‚ÄúFight on‚úåÔ∏è!‚Äù as the ending.

## The room where it happens
Given the popularity and proven efficient communication, it is not surprising to see emojis eventually
invaded courtrooms.
Recent years have witnessed a rise in cases with emoji as evidence. 
According to [Santa Clara Law professor Eric Goldman](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/01/emoji-law-2018-year-in-review.htm), 
back in 2004 there is only one case involving emojis, and the number goes above 100 in 2019.
Yet the cultural aspect of emojis propose a new challenges for judges. 
Only one char need to convey deep meaning

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cc_and_me.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you‚Äôll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖYou can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖTo have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖNote that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.‚ãÖ‚ãÖ
‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
