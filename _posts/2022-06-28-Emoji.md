Have you seen this crying face😭? How about 😂, 🥺, 🤣, or ❤️? Looks familiar? Well, you should be. According to emojipedia, [they are the top 5 most used emojipedia in twitters in 2021](https://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-trends-of-2021/).
By December 2021, a total of 21.54% of all global tweets have at least one of the 3,633 emojis approved by the [Unicode Consortium](https://blog.emojipedia.org/unicode-behind-the-curtain/).
In fact, emoji becomes so popular that [Oxford dictionary listed 😂 as the word of 2015](https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2015/).
Nowadays people are using emoji in virtually any platform, including [Tiktok](https://emojipedia.org/tiktok/),
[instagram](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-the-emoji-slider-sticker)
, or [email](https://www.guidingtech.com/top-ways-to-insert-emojis-in-a-microsoft-outlook-email/)
. Many people even [choose to incorporate emoji into their username](https://start.y.at/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F).
In fact, an Artificial Intelligence startup huggingface 🤗 is 
evaluated [at $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/05/09/the-2-billion-emoji-hugging-face-wants-to-be-launchpad-for-a-machine-learning-revolution/?sh=61b47f51f732)
and will potentially be the first company to “go public with an emoji, rather than a three-letter ticker”.

## From XD to 😂

In our daily face-to-face conversations, 
we often make use of body language, facial expression or acoustic tone <d-cite key="chen2017through"></d-cite> to better convey our emotions. 
Yet such means becomes impossible when we move toward online conversations, 
in which we have access to text and plain text only. 
Scott Fahlman is probably one of the first people to try imitating more diverse and profound information with plain text. 
Emoticons, as later was called, were designed to convey emotion using plain ASCII characters, 
two of the most famous Emoticon being “:-)” and “:-(“. 
While emoticons like "XD" is easy to understand due to resemble to human faces, 
some of the emoticons seem to be more cultural orientated and hard to be understood by someone outside of the community.
For example, I probably would never guess the meaning for "#‑)"<d-footnote>If you are also wondering, it means "partied all night".</d-footnote>
Of course, the never-satisfaied internet users demand more expressive symbols, leading to the development of emoticon's succeeder, emoji. 

Originated in Japanese 絵文字, the name _emoji_ itself precisely express its function: 絵 (e) being picture, while 文字 (moji) being character.
The first widely-used emoji is designed by Shigetaka Kurita. 
[It has 250 characters only](https://emojitimeline.com/#:~:text=The%20World's%20First%20Emoji%20Set,Unicode%20Standard%2C%20the%20poo%20emoji). 
From this we can grasp what Sheigetaka deemed as the top 250 most important characters in the daily conversation at that time.

Emojis gradually become an integral component in postmodern language.
It is estimated that 92% of the online population use emoji, and at least 2.3 trillion mobile messages
incorporate emoji annually as of 2016 <d-cite key="goldman2018emojis"></d-cite>.
In 2021, Adobe [released the global emoji trend report](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/15/global-emoji-trend-report-2021)
showing that 55% of global emoji users are more comfortable expressing emotions through emoji than phone conversations, 
90% of global emoji users agree that emoji make it easier for them to express themselves. 
What's more, although having only 23 years of history, emojis themselves are still expanding rapidly. 
Emoji version 8 (so-called Unicode Version 8.0) came up in 2015, i.e. 8 versions in 16 years, while version 14 came out last year, i.e. roughly one updated version in each year.
Therefore, it is not so surprising to see someone will exclaim something like this:
{% twitter https://twitter.com/kylekuzma/status/1539544755830288384 %}

## Emojis are cultural construct 🤔
Don’t you like emoji? 
Don’t you think adding a cute emoji makes the conversation more friendly 😉? 
Adobe report shows that 88% of the global emoji users are more likely to feel empathetic toward someone if they use an emoji. 
I remember once I wanted to do research with a professor at USC, and write a long email expressing my eagerness and my competency. 
In the end, I want to “appeal to the emotion” and want my professor to have some personal connection with me. 
Hey, we all belong to the Trojan family, I thought. 
Thus I typed “Fight on✌️!” in the end of the email 
(by the way [this is also the favorite emoji in USC](https://twitter.com/usc/status/1151504550018203648?lang=en)!). 
I hope that this will give the professor a sense of bondness. 
Does it work? Well, I did get the opportunity of doing research, and in the email my Professor sent back, she also concludes the email with  “Fight on✌️!”

Use paper word
Emoji, as a medium of conversation, inevitably 
The interpretation of emoji is conditioned on the person. 
Trojan motto is embedded in the simple emoji ✌️, but what about the outsiders? 
How will they perceive the symbol✌️? 
According to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/victory-hand/), 
the symbol ✌️, or victory hand, represnts nothing but the [V sign](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/V_sign). 
It is USC and its motto that injects the meaning of fight on into it, 
therefore if I am going to send someone outside of Trojan family, 
I probably won’t use  “Fight on✌️!” as the ending.

## The room where it happens ⚖️
Given the popularity and proven efficient communication, it is not surprising to see emojis eventually invaded courtrooms.
Recent years have witnessed a rise in cases with emoji as evidence. 
According to [Santa Clara Law professor Eric Goldman](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/01/emoji-law-2018-year-in-review.htm), 
back in 2004 there is only one case involving emojis, and the number goes above 100 in 2019.
Yet the cultural aspect of emojis proposes a new challenges for judges. 
Only one char need to convey deep meaning

Image you as a landlord, what will you think if you receive a prospective teanent’s message that reads: 
> “Good Morning😊 Interested in the house 💃👯‍♀️✌☄🐿️🍾 When’s a good time for you?”  
 
A married couple Nir and Yarden [sent exactly this to the landlord](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/01/the-israeli-chipmunk-emoji-mystery-resolved.htm)
, who, after reading this message, decided to take down the apartment from the housing listing website and sending message back to Nir and Yarden regarding details of the housing contract.
Yet the only response he got from the couple after a few days is that they already rented another apartment.

  <figcaption class="text-center">One sentence and seven emojis can cost you $2,200.
    What does it mean? It means whatever you think it means!
    </figcaption>
</figure>
Agitated, the landloard sued the couples for damages, claiming reliance
—a special contract law in Israel, 
that a party acting in reliance on another’s expressed and sometimes implied intent to agree to a deal may file suit 
if damaged when the other party doesn’t follow through.
How will you judge this case? 
The couple never explicitly confirmed that they will rent the house, 
in fact, they only ask to schedule a meeting with the landlord, and had never signed any contract. 
However, the ruling by Judge Amir Weizebbluth is quite the opposite of what we might think. 
He argued that in this text message full of pictograms, smiling face 😊, dancing 💃👯‍♀️, champigan 🍾 all convey “great optimism”. 
He further claim that
> Although this message did not constitute a binding contract between the parties, [it] naturally led to the Plaintiff’s great reliance on the Defendants’ desire to rent his apartment…

With the postive signal, the landlord decision is understanable, if not perfectly reasonable based on the couple’s 
optimistic and colorful language. 
In the end, Nir and Yarden had to pay $2,200 for the bad faith negotiation.
At first glance, this seems rather arbitary 
that several emojios would cost two grand. I myself would rather consider the emojis to be a technique to be more approachable, 
similarly to what I have done when sending “fight on” to my professor. 
None of those emojis are equivalent to the couple’s agreement for contract. 
Besides, what does squiral have to do with positive anyway? 
Due to the controversal outcome, this case became a classic in lawsuites that involve emojis, arousing debate on whether 
such complicated and multi-meaning emojis can be used as a convincing evidence.


The differetn implemtnation of emoji standards in various platform adds another layer of complexity.
You might think you send a laughing 😁 emoji to convey a positive signal, but 
the receiver [might think you are feeling embrassing and awkard if he happens to have an IPhone](
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-emojis-failing-evolve-form-language-rahul-das/
).

Even in the case of same implementation, due to the releative small size, some emojis can be confused with another.
Consider the following [outrageous caes happens in German](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2021/09/a-roundup-of-german-caselaw-regarding-emojis-and-emoticons-guest-blog-post.htm)
where two employees are accused to insult two managers in the company.
Here is an excerpt of the chat history between the two employees

> Employee 1: The fat 🐷 goes crazy!!! 😜😜😜
> 
> Employee 2: You mean the piglet roasting on a spit!!! 😭😭
> 
> Employee 1: Hahahah
> 
> Employee 2: “And the 🐵head too!!! 😂😂😂😜😜
 
While the first fat 🐷 is rather obvious, the phrase 🐵head gather much attention from judges. 
Calling someone monkey head is not the most polite thing term someone should call the manager, 
but calling the manager bear head is indeed considered an insult, given the manager’s broad facial features. 
However, later in the assessment of the judges it seems that the two employees mistakenly perceive  
<figure>

  </picture>
  <figcaption class="text-center">
    The emoji of monkey and bear showing in the employee's phone screen.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
This emoji and how the employee perceive this (although deviate from the standard norm) becomes the evidence judge makes the claim of insultance.


Not all emojis are created equal. Some emojis are more likely to get you arrested.
[In 2016, there was a 12-year old that got arrested after posting on Instagram with 
🔫🔪💣
emojis](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-12-year-old-girl-is-facing-criminal-charges-for-using-emoji-and-shes-not-the-only-one-2016-2).
However, this “might get you arrested” list of emojis are not exhaustive. 
Even an emoji that appears innocent and neutral in a majority of scenarios can be found threatening in certain context.

[For example](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/judge-stumped-by-emoji-threat/JARMEX55HERKD5NMFJVINCOLWY/),
a judge sent a woman’s ex-partner in jail for eight months for sending the following message to woman’s social media account:
> You're going to f***ing get it,✈
 
Even though the aeroplane is considered harmless in most cases, in this scenario both woman and he judge agree that this is a symobl of threatening, suggesting that the ex-partner is coming to her.
It seems that we have left in the sitution puzzling about what those little pictograms mean when deriving form context. 
It is hard to gain a universal consenous about whether they indicate a sense of anger, humour or other emotions, which probably is not what the inventer of emojis.


The rapid-changing emojis have impeded the judgements in court. If emoji were to function as an evidence, discriminating
the inherent definiton becomes a virtual problem. The existing emojipedia is far from satisfaction, as it provides explantion
purely based on the designer's intention. However in practice the precise interpration depends on the context and who is sending the emoji.
Adobe 63% of Gen Z’ers mention that they use emoji differently than their intended meaning, 
with the most misunderstood emojis being 🍆<d-footnote>Interesting, Pornhub has released its own set of emojis, entitled "Emoji 4 Porn", with eggplant being one of them.</d-footnote>
One time when I send a meme to my American friend, he replied me with "funny 🙂". 
Then [as a chinese](https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/),
I begun to question myself if I have done anything wrong to him, since we Chinese only use smiling face
as a sutble medium to convey mocking and despise. 
Japan also has their own emoji culture that differ from American's.
Researchers at Princeton and University College London have trained a neural network on English Tweeters and 
project a list of emojis into a 2D Cartesian plane <d-cite key="eisner2016emoji2vec"></d-cite>.
The visualization is shown in the left figure below.
The closer two emojis are in the plane, the semantically closer the two emojis are. 
We can observe several clusters including cluster of national flags, cluster of digits and cluster of laughing faces etc. 
Yet such pattern is not universal, 
as found by Japanese researchers at Univesity of Tsukuba <d-cite key="tomihira2020multilingual"></d-cite>.
They conduct similar experiments on Japanese social media and found that laughing are not tightly close <d-footnote>
They use common emojis used by Japanese, which is also significantly less than Americans.</d-footnote>.

They credit the disparity in emoji semnatic similiartiy to the difference in emoji culture. They found that for the same sentencec Japanese sometimes
will react in a different emoji.
