Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 4th year undergraduate student double majoring in applied mathematics and computer science at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/).
At USC, I had the honor to work with Professor [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/), Professor [Yan Liu](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/), Professor [Mohammad Soleymani](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~soleymani/), and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/).

My current research interests is in `machine learning` and `natural language processing`. Particularly,
- transparent and robust NLP system
- high-level supervisions for model regularization

This is my girlfriend [Carmen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-liang/) and me
